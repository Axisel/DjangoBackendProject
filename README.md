# DjangoBackendProject - Quiz website

Kipo Quiz is a website that I coded using Django, this framework allowed me to implement CRUD fonctionnalities on this quiz application.

The purpose of this website is to display quiz created by users. Users can create new quiz, edit the questions and choice of these quiz and delete them. The users can add an illustration photo, a description and a title to the quiz, alongside with of course questions and their possible choices.

For the moment user can't do the quiz but this function will be implemented. There also will be a leaderboard to see the best users on each quiz.
